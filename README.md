## About Me ðŸ“•

ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

I am a junior studying Computer Science at the University of Washington with both project-based and industry experience in data analytics using Java, C++, and Python. 

Currently, I am working as Startup UW's Website Manager updating the webpage.

Please note: My GitHub profile is limited, as I am not allowed to include many school projects and code from internships due to confidentiality policies.
